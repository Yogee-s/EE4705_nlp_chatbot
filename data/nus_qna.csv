"Students from Cohort AY2020-21 and before read only 5 GE courses, but the GE curriculum is different for me. Why?","Students admitted from AY2021/22 onwards (except Law, Medicine, Dentistry) follow a new GE curriculum with six pillars. You must take one course per pillar. Some programs (USP, UTCP, RVRC) may already cover some pillars, and remaining pillars must be fulfilled via GE courses."
"Do I need to read 24 Units of GE courses every year, or is the 24 Units requirement for the entire programme?","You need to read 24 Units of GE courses **throughout your entire programme**, not every year."
"I am confused by the different GE course prefixes. What are the differences?","Prefix codes: GEH, GEQ, GER, GES, GET were for cohorts before AY2021/22. For AY2021/22 onward: GEA (Data Literacy), GEI (Digital Literacy), GEX (Critique & Expression), GEC (Cultures & Connections), GESS (Singapore Studies), GEN (Communities & Engagement). Up to 8 units may double-count with your Major/Minor subject to rules."
"I am a polytechnic diploma holder – which GE course am I granted Advanced Placement Credits (APCs) for?","If you are granted APCs for a course that satisfies a GE pillar, you will be exempted from that GE pillar."
"I want to take courses abroad during exchange. Can they count as GE courses?","If your exchange university courses map to GE pillars and get approved, they count. Submit mapping requests in EduRec before exchange. After return, request credit transfer."
"How do I register for GE courses?","Register GE courses via EduRec’s Course Registration (CourseReg). Do not use GEH, GEQ, GER, GES, GET prefixes for AY2021/22+ cohorts to fulfill GE requirements. Also ensure you don’t exceed the limit on Level-1000 courses."
"I didn’t get the GE course I wanted this semester. Are GE courses offered every semester?","Not necessarily. Some GE courses are only in Semester 1, others only in Semester 2."
"Where can I find timetables for GE courses?","Use **NUSMods** to check class schedules, tutorial times, and exam time-tables."
"What is the maximum number of Units I can take in a semester?","That depends on your faculty. Contact your Faculty Dean’s Office for the cap for your programme."
"How do I know if my GE course has tutorials?","Check NUSMods — tutorial slots will be indicated."
"Can I take extra GE courses after fulfilling GE requirements?","Yes. Excess GE courses can be counted toward your Unrestricted Elective requirements."
